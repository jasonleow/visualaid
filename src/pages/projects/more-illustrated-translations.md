We think there is lot of potential for illustrated translations in the healthcare setting, and the first two sets for migrant workers might just be the beginning! We responded to the need of the times (COVID-19, that is), but we foresee that this can go beyond our current situation, to reach other groups of patients. One possible group is the elderly.
