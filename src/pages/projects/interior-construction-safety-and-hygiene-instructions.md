With the end of our Circuit Breaker on 2 Jun, construction and infrastructure projects are set to resume gradually, with stringent measures in place. We worked with a construction company to come up with this set of instructional posters in Chinese, Tamil, Bengali, Hindi, Burmese, Vietnamese, to help migrant workers stay informed of the mandatory work site practices.
