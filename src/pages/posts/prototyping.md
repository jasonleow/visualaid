We did this sometime last week. Memories were hazy, as the days were intense. But because we're designers and because we believe that we need to test out our ideas with real users, we decided to prototype the idea we had â€“ illustrated translations. 

This was during the strictest of strict period of Circuit Breaker. When no print shop is open to print anything for us. When no stationary shop is open for us to get lamination sheets. 

Luckily, Shaina remembered an old lamination machine somewhere in her store room, and we got our prototype out to the nurses at NCID. Circuit Breaker or no, nothing ain't gonna stop us, now.
