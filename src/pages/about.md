This website was inspired by the work of Sudesna Roy Chowdhury's [website](https://sudesnaroychowdhury.wixsite.com/covid), a treasure trove of COVID-19-related translations for healthcare workers. We took that as a starting point of our project, did more field research and prototyping to come up with VisualAid.

\
VisualAid is a volunteer-driven project. We are **not affiliated to any organization**. Shout out to all the volunteers for burning weekends and late nights:
